# TypeScript Discord Bot Template
A template for people wanting to create discord bots using TypeScript. This template uses the discord.js package along with a MongoDB database which is accessed using mongoose. Docker files are also included in this template for anyone that uses docker to host their discord bot.

**1.** Clone this repository locally by running `git clone https://github.com/CitTheDev/ts-discord-bot` in the terminal (Install git if you do not have it already)

**2.** Run `npm i` in the terminal. This should install all necessary packages.

**3.** Open the `src/config.ts` file and enter all the information needed.

**4.** Open the `src/index.ts` file and provide all the necessary intents and partials.
